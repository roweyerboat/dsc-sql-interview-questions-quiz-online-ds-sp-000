    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT\n",
    "INTEGER\n",
    "REAL\n",
    "BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to use other data types from other kinds of sql but they are lumped into the main four.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Keys are unique identifiers for the table.  There can only be unique entries in these columns.  Foreign keys are a primary key from a different table.  The relationship between them is you can match a primary key from one table to the foreign key of another in order to join the tables to line up the corresponding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of relationships entities that can exist in a SQL database: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.\n",
    "One-to-one would mean a row in a table has exactly one matching row to in another table.\n",
    "One-to-many would mean one row in one table is connected to many rows in another table.  For example, an employee could be a sales rep to many customers.\n",
    "Many-to-many would mean many rows in one table pair with many rows in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN - All the records from the first table and the second table are joined where the join condition is met\n",
    "LEFT JOIN - All the records from the first table along with records from the second table for which the join condition is met\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN - All the records from the second table along with records from the first table for which the join condition is met\n",
    "OUTER JOIN - All the records are join regardless if they have a match with the other table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions are functions like COUNT or MEAN or MIN.  These can perform those calculations on a group that we specify.  We can use GROUP BY to let SQL know what mean we are looking for.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Associative Entities allow us to perform many-to-many JOINs as they keep track of the connections of the entity in one table as well as to the second table.  It is used to join the two tables on the many-to-many relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
